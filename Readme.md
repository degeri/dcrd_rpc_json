# DCRD JSON RPC Requests

Just a almost complete list/examples of DCRD requests.

Made with testnet3

start dcrd with 

`dcrd --testnet --txindex --addrindex`


curl.sh just calls dcrd with the contents of the folders. (Rename folder `stop` to `zstop` to ensure it completes a full round)



Does not have :-

getwork

generate

setgenerate
